### 🔬 Enhanced Features Generated (53 total features used)

The winning LinearRegression model uses 53 engineered features derived from the above base columns:

#### **Rate Statistics (Per Game)** (additional 10 features)
- `R_per_G`, `H_per_G`, `HR_per_G`, `BB_per_G`, `SO_per_G`, `SB_per_G`
- `RA_per_G`, `ER_per_G`, `E_per_G`, `DP_per_G`

#### **Pitching Rate Statistics (Per 9 Innings)** (additional 4 features)
- `HA_per_9`, `HRA_per_9`, `BBA_per_9`, `SOA_per_9`

#### **Sabermetric Statistics** (additional 6 features)
- `OBP` (On-Base Percentage): (H + BB) / (AB + BB)
- `BA` (Batting Average): H / AB  
- `SLG` (Slugging Percentage): Total Bases / AB
- `OPS` (On-Base Plus Slugging): OBP + SLG
- `BB_rate` (Walk Rate): BB / Plate Appearances
- `SO_rate` (Strikeout Rate): SO / Plate Appearances

#### **Run Environment & Pythagorean Stats** (additional 3 features)
- `Run_Diff` (Run Differential): R - RA
- `Pyth_Win_Pct` (Pythagorean Win %): R² / (R² + RA²)
- `Pyth_Wins` (Pythagorean Wins): Pyth_Win_Pct × 162

#### **Interaction Features** (additional 3 features)
- `OPS_x_RunDiff`: OPS × Run_Diff (captures offensive impact on wins)
- `R_per_H` (Run Efficiency): R / H
- `WHIP` (Walks + Hits per Inning Pitched): (HA + BBA) / IP

#### **Original Features (Processed)**
- All base counting stats after median imputation and variance filtering
- League context (`mlb_rpg`)

#### **Excluded Features (Redundant)**
- **Era/Decade Variables**: Originally one-hot encoded (optimal format), but excluded from final model as sabermetric features (`Pyth_Win_Pct`, `Run_Diff`, `mlb_rpg`) captured temporal effects more effectively

### 🔬 **Technical Note: One-Hot vs Categorical Encoding**
The original era/decade variables were properly **one-hot encoded** (binary True/False indicators), which is the optimal format for:
- **LinearRegression**: Treats each era independently without assuming ordinal relationships
- **Interpretability**: Each coefficient represents the specific effect of that era/decade
- **Mathematical Correctness**: Avoids imposing artificial linear progression across time periods
- **Performance**: Prevents the model from learning spurious temporal trends

### 📈 Model Performance

- **❌ NOT Bagging**: No bootstrap sampling of training data
- **❌ NOT Boosting**: No sequential learning or error correction
- **❌ NOT Stacking**: No meta-learner to combine predictions

#### **How VotingRegressor Works**:
1. **Train Models Independently**: Each model (LinearRegression, Ridge α=0.5, Ridge α=1.0) trained on the same 53-feature dataset
2. **Generate Predictions**: Each model produces independent predictions for test data
3. **Simple Average**: Final prediction = arithmetic mean of all model predictions
4. **No Weighting**: Equal weight (1/3) given to each model's prediction

#### **Mathematical Formula**:
```
Final_Prediction = (LinearReg_Pred + Ridge0.5_Pred + Ridge1.0_Pred) / 3
```

#### **Why VotingRegressor Over Other Ensemble Methods**:
- **Simplicity**: No complex meta-learning or sequential training
- **Diversity**: Combines different regularization strengths (none, moderate, strong)
- **Stability**: Reduces variance through averaging without overfitting
- **Interpretability**: Easy to understand and debug individual model contributions
- **Efficiency**: Fast training and prediction (no bootstrap samples or sequential stages)

#### **Model Diversity Strategy**:
- **LinearRegression**: Pure OLS fit, captures full linear relationships
- **Ridge α=0.5**: Light regularization, balances bias-variance tradeoff  
- **Ridge α=1.0**: Moderate regularization, better generalization to unseen data
- **Combined Effect**: Ensemble benefits from both unregularized precision and regularized stability
